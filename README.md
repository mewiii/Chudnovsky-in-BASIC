# Chudnovsky-in-BASIC
Various implementations of the Chudnovsky Algorithm in BASIC.

## Creator
The code shared here is created and maintaned by Deanna Wilborne, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Berea College in Berea, KY. These programs were created mostly for the "fun of it", and to illustrate what various BASIC implementations can do using the [Chudnovsky algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm) to compute Pi to various precisions.

## Code Currently in Repository
* The [Apple ```][``` Applesoft BASIC](https://github.com/mewiii/Chudnovsky-in-BASIC/blob/main/Apple2/CPI-A2P3.md) version uses only one iteration of the Chudnovsky algorithm to compute Pi to the limit of the floating point precision of Applesoft BASIC. Load the program and RUN it to see the output of different ways to create Pi.
* The VB.net version was created on a MacBook Pro ARM64 machine and works great. It has been tested to 5,000 digits of Pi. Usage of the program will be added soon.
